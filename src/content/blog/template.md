This is my test article.
I'm so tired that I keep writing this code for 2 hours

## Test Section 2
"Size," Julian Huxley once remarked, "has a fascination of its own." We
 stock our zoos with elephants, hippopotamuses, giraffes, and gorillas; who
 among you was not cheering for King Kong in his various battles on top of tall
 buildings? (1)This focus on the few creatures larger than ourselves makes us
 lose sight of our actual size. Most people think that is a
 creature of only modest dimensions. In fact, humans are among the largest
 animals on earth; more than 99 percent of animal species are smaller than we
 are. Of 190 species in our own *order of primates, (2)0nly the gorilla
 regularly exceeds us in size.
 In our self-appointed role as the ruler of all creatures, we have taken great
 interest in pointing out the features that permitted us to attain this superior
 status. Our brain, upright posture, development of speech, and group hunting
 (to name just (3)a few) are often mentioned, but I have been (4)struck by how
 rarely our large size has been recognized as a controlling factor of our
 evolutionary progress.
 Highly-developed intelligence was, as a matter of fact, essential for the
 rise to our current status. But, could we have evolved it with much smaller
 body sizes? One day, at the New York World's Fair in 1964, I entered the hall
 of Free Enterprise to escape the rain. Inside, prominently displayed, was an
 ant *colony bearing the sign: "Twenty million years without evolutionary
 progress. Why? Because the ant colony is a socialist, totalitarian system."
 (5)The statement scarcely requires serious attention; nonetheless, I should
 point out that ants are doing very well for themselves, and that it is their
 size rather than their social structure that prevents them from evolving high
 mental capacity.
 In this age of the transistor, we can put radios in watchcases and *bug
 telephones with minute electronic devices. Such miniaturization might lead us
 to the false belief that absolute size is unimportant to the operation of
 complex machinery. But nature does not miniaturize *neurons (or other cells
 for that matter). The range of cell size among *organisms is incomparably
 smaller than the range in body size. This is why small animals simply have far
 fewer cells than large animals. The human brain contains several billion
 neurons; an ant, because of the limitation of its small size, has many hundreds
 of times fewer neurons.
## Tese Section 3
 Relearning the art of seeing the world around us is quite simple, although
 (a)it takes practice and requires breaking some bad habits. And "relearn" is
 the correct word. Most of us observed much more as children than we do as
 adults. A child's day is filled with newness and wonder. The desire to explore,
 to have an adventure, gave us all a natural ability to be aware of the world
 around us. But as adults we are slow to be stimulated by new ideas and new
 situations. We fail to see the wonder of the things around us.
 The first step in awakening our senses is to rediscover the ability to
 observe that we had as children. To do so we need to stop anticipating what
 we are going to see and feel before it happens. Such anticipation blocks our
 ability to feel.
 For example, one chilly night I was on a mountain hike with some students.
 I told them that we were going to have to cross a mountain stream. They began
 to grumble about how cold it would be. We reached the stream and they
 reluctantly plunged ahead. They were almost up to their knees in the water when
 they realized that I had led them into a hot spring. Later they all said that
 they had felt cold water at first.
 We also need to notice (4)signs which can help us see more. Once I was on
 a hike, following about six meters behind my Indian friend named Stalking Wolf.
 As we passed under a huge pine tree. he turned around and said, "Don't disturb
 it." Surprised, I looked everywhere. Was there a deer, a fox, or something else
 that I had missed seeing? Finally I looked into the branches of the tree and
 saw a beautiful owl not three meters from us.
 I was amazed that Stalking Wolf had known it was there without looking up.
 When I asked him how he had known the owl was there, he replied, "Go ask the
 mice." By looking down he had seen the tracks of the mice that had run away
 from their dreaded enemy, the owl.
 (b)The next time you take a walk, no matter where it is, open up your eyes.
 Be aware of all the sights, sounds and sensations. You will be surprised at
 the many beautiful and interesting things you have been missing
